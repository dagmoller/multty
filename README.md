Multty SSH Multiplexer

Multty is a tmux-based script that allows one to log into several machines simultaneously and interact with them, selectively directing input to individual machines or groups of selected machines.

This is a "clone" of Omnitty (http://omnitty.sourceforge.net/).

OBS: This requires tmux 2.0+ to work...
